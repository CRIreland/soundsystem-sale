## Cabinets and Drivers


### Turbosound Floodlights

Really crisp classic midtops from Turbosound!

These are the original square cabinets (not trap boxes) and come updated with NL8 speakon connectors and with soft flight covers. 

Can throw in some DIY adjustable angle tilt boards I made for them too if wanted.  

£1200 for the pair.

### Ligwa Earthshakers (Void V18-1000)

4 x MDF Ligwa Earthshaker Scoops, loaded with V18-1000 drivers from Void.

No beating around the bush, these have had a tough life and are due some TLC. Still great sounding cabinets though, and would be perfect for a suicide rig (wait till Covids done please...)

  1. Loaded - £1000
  2. Unloaded - £400
  3. Drivers - £700. 
  
  Prices are for 4. Will consider splitting.
  
NOTE - currently got interest in 2 loaded so looking for another buyer for the other pair (£500 loaded)

### ES18's (Fane 18B) SOLD

4 x ES18's, 18mm birch ply, fully rebated solid builds with castors. Loaded with Fane 18B. 

Note - these were built as 2 pairs, and the handle cutout placement is slightly different. This has no effect on the sound and won't be seen unless you look closely.

  1. Loaded - £800
  2. Unloaded - £450
  3. Drivers - £400
  
Prices are for 4. Will consider splitting.

### Zeck Midtops

Little midtops manufactured by Zeck (yup I've never heard of Zeck either...) loaded with JBL 15" and b&c de25 compression drivers. I'm really sad to see these go, they sound amazing, though they do currently look like shite with the green grills. I've labelled them as midtops becuase they don't handle bass very well, but they'd be fine on full range as monitors or infill or something. 

£300 for the pair (no offers).

 1. Cabinets - £200
 2. Drivers - £250
